## DAT250 ASSIGNMENT 6: MESSAGING

### Group members:
#### - Lyder Samn√∏y

When starting this assignment, i decided to revert the git repo back to assignment 3. This was done because the folder structure had become incredibly questionable, and I needed some of the java files I had removed in past assignments. The prev versions of the repo are still available.

Implementing the messaging system was straight forward. I added a config file for RabbitMQ, as well as a Listener and Publisher class for the messages.
PollController was updated to add the messages via EventPublisher.java.

When I loaded into localhost:15672 to view the RabbitMQ, spikes in activity were visible when I f.ex. created a new poll. indicating that the implementation worked.

I had a terrible time working with git this time around, but the content in the repo should be unaffected. Either way, i could not merge this branch into main.
