## DAT250 ASSIGNMENT 6: MESSAGING

### Group members:

When starting this assignment, i decided to revert the git repo back to assignment 3. This was done because the folder structure had become incredibly questionable, and I needed some of the java files I had removed in past assignments. The prev versions of the repo are still available.

Implementing the messaging system was straight forward. I added a config file for RabbitMQ, as well as a Listener and Publisher class for the messages.
