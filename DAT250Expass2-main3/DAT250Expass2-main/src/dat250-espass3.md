## DAT250 ASSIGNMENT 3: SPA

### Group members:
#### - Lyder Samnøy
#### - Marius Reikerås

### Git-isssues
For this assignment, I (Lyder Samnøy) decided to create my own repository instead of using Marius' repo as was the case with Expass2. At the start, only using one repo for a group assignment seemed natural, but as the course progressed, it now seems like having our own repositories is more ideal.

This time around, we both created our own versions of Expass3 in the lab session. The problem was that I made the decision to switch repos after already finishing Expass3, and there were quite a few kinks in porting the project over to my new repo. Needless to say i am not very experienced with GitHub.

### Installation
Marius suggested using Vue for this assignment, which we had no problems installing. We did however run into problems with node.js not being installed/not being the correct version
### Development
Implementing the components was fine, and I managed to connect the frontend and backend using the two localhost addresses quite quickly. There was however a problem when deploying the project in the end using npm run build. It created the files, but the /src/main/resources/static file did not exist in my directory, so I had to create that file manually, and I can not tell if it is working correctly. Marius did not have this problem at all.
