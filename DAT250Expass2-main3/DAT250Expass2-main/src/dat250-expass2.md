### Installation 
No problems installing required software and creating the spring boot application (all from prev. assignment). We ran into minor difficulties with IntelliJ as some features are not available in all versions. This was solved with a simple reinstall.

### Development
We took some time learning the ropes with IntelliJ, as we had little prior experience with this IDE. For the java files, we made use of the lecture examples on GitHub which can be found here: https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250public/blob/master/lectureexamples/l04_domain_serde/app/src/main/java/no/hvl/dat250/l04/examples/domains/Polls.java

for the HTTP requests, we used IntelliJ's inbuilt HTTP request file feature to quickly create the request sequence given in the assignment. The tests are conducted by running the localhost and then running the HTTP file from the IDE. 

We only ran into minor problems when integrating the HTTP requests, mainly slight formatting mistakes and some incorrect identifiers. This was solved by examining the error logs in the HTTP request output.

We did not develop the tests in a *test-driven approach* as stipulated in the assignment. Instead, we developed the java code and the HTTP requests asynchronously so we could get the code ready faster.
